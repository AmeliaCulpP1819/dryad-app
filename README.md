# stash

### Introduction

**Stash** is a **UC3** service for storing and sharing research data.  Stash, a replacement for UC3â€™s current Dash service (UC3, 2015), is simple self-service repository overlay layer for submission and discovery of research datasets.  Stash is intended to be applicable to any standards-compliant repository that supports the SWORD protocol for deposit and the OAI-PMH protocol for metadata harvesting.  Stash enables individual scholars to:

1. Prepare datasets for curation by reviewing best practice guidance for the creation or acquisition of research data.
2. Select data for curation through local file browse or drag-and-drop operation.
3. Describe data in terms of scientifically-meaning metadata.
4. Identify datasets for persistent citation, reference, and retrieval.
5. Preserve, manage, and share data in an appropriate data repository.
6. Discover, retrieve, and reuse data through faceted search and browse.

By alleviating many of the barriers that have historically precluded wider adoption of open data principles, Stash empowers individual scholars to assert active curation control over their research outputs; encourages more widespread data preservation, publication, sharing, and reuse; and promotes open scholarly inquiry and advancement.
