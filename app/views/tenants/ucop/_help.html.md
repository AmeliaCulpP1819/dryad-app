## Submission Basics
Use this checklist to prepare your dataset for submission. See our Policies section below for more information.

1.  Inform your dataset co-creators that you plan to publish the dataset
2.  Ensure that all governmental and institutional regulations regarding the handling of sensitive data are addressed
3.  Prepare or obtain the most up-to-date and complete version of dataset
4.  Prepare or obtain relevant explanatory documents related to the dataset (e.g., readme.txt files, formal metadata records, or other critical information, etc.)
5.  Gather the following information, to be entered as metadata (see Metadata Basics section below for more information):

  - Dataset title (make sure to be as descriptive as possible)
  - Full names of all dataset co-creators (or better yet, include ORCIDs for each creator)
  - Keywords for the dataset (use discipline-specific controlled vocabularies whenever possible)
  - Abstract (this is a description describing the dataset you are submitting)
  - Methods (description of the methods used to collect the data)
  - Usage Notes (instructions for other researchers to use or explore the data)
  - Funding Information : Name of the funding organization that supported creation of the resource, including applicable grant number(s)
  - Related Works including grant numbers, publications using the dataset, and other related datasets 

## Metadata Basics
Comprehensive data documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key to future understanding of data. Without a thorough description of the context of the data file, the context in which the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality of the data, it is unlikely that the data can be easily discovered, understood, or effectively used. Metadata is important not only to help people understand and make proper use of a data resource, but metadata also makes the resource discoverable (for example through internet searches or data indexing services). Read more about metadata in the [DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

A complete list of our default metadata fields is below. Additional metadata can be uploaded alongside the dataset (e.g., as a readme.txt file). Our default metadata entry form is based on fields from the metadata schema of the DOI issuing agency, DataCite. 

Required Fields:

- Title : Title of the dataset. Make sure to be as descriptive as possible
- Author(s) or Data Creator(s) : Name and institutional affliation of main researcher(s) involved in producing the data.  If you include your [ORCID](http://orcid.org), we will request the ORCID registry auto-populate this publication on your ORCID profile
- Data type : Type of data. This entry is constrained to a list from the DOI issuing agency, DataCite.  Choose one that closest associated with your data

Optional Fields (the more you describe your dataset, the wider the reach):

- Keyword(s) : Descriptive words that may help others discover your dataset. Dash recommends that you determine whether your discipline has an existing controlled vocabulary from which to choose your keywords. Please enter as many keywords as applicable
- Abstract : An abstract or general description of the dataset
- Methods : Any technical or methodological information that may help others to understand how the data were generated
- Usage Notes : Any technical or methodological information that may help others determine how the data may be properly reused
- Funding Information : Name of the funding organization that supported creation of the resource, including applicable grant number(s)
- Related Works : Use this field to indicate other resources that are associated with the data. Examples include publications, other datasets, etc.
-  Location information : Include the geo-corridinates or name of the location where your data were generated or the location that is the focus of your research

##  Upload Basics
Here is some basic information on uploading datasets. See Policies section below for more details.

- We accept all file formats, although it is good practice to share data using open formats. See the [UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table) for a list of optimal file formats
- Include any files that may help others to use your data. This includes readme files, formal metadata files, or other critical information
- Any data submitted will be under the [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). We do not currently support any other license types, nor do we allow for restrictions on data access or use
- It is your responsibility to ensure your data are being shared responsibly and ethically. Please be careful of sharing sensitive data and ensure you are complying with institutional and governmental regulations

#### Can I use if my campus is not listed?

Anyone can search, view and download datasets. However, for each campus-specific website, data submission is limited to individuals
affiliated with that campus.  Contact [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for more information.

#### Who can use DataONE Dash?
DataONE Dash is a separate service, operated by CDL in collaboration with the
[DataONE project](http://dataone.org/). Anyone can deposit Environmental and Earth observation data within
[DataONE Dash](https://oneshare.cdlib.org/). Contact uc3@ucop.edu for more
information.

### What content is appropriate? 

#### What type of data is within scope?

All fields of scholarship. All types of research artifacts. However, this service is
intended for complete, final research datasets and all content must not violate
privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or nondisclosure for data
collected from human subjects.

#### How should I prepare to submit data?
Here is some basic information on submitting datasets. See the Submission Basics section above for more details.

- Obtain permission from the appropriate Principal Investigators(s) and
  inform any dataset co-creators that you plan to deposit the dataset in
  Dash.
- Take care when sharing sensitive data, and be certain to comply with
  institutional and governmental regulations. It is your responsibility to
  share your data responsibly and ethically.
- Collect the files comprising the data set. Name files systematically and
  use open file formats whenever possible (see the UK Data Archive for a
  [list of optimal file formats](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table)).
  Gather the following information to fully describe the dataset:
 - Dataset title - be as specific as possible
 - Full names and institutional affiliations of all dataset co-creators
 - Keywords for the dataset (use discipline-specific controlled vocabularies
  whenever possible)
 - Abstract briefly describing the dataset you are submitting– What is the
  data? Why was it collected?
 - Description of the methods used to collect the data
 - Related works and associated materials, including grant numbers, publications
  using the dataset, and other related datasets
 - If relevant, information about where the data was collected (e.g., the
  placename or lat/long coordinates)
 - Any other information that you would want to relay to someone analyzing
  your data

For generic data management help, see the
[DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

#### What are the file format requirements?

We accept files in any format for deposit. However, we recommend using
non-proprietary/open file types to make the data readable by more
researchers over a longer span of time. (See the UK Data Archive for a
[list of optimal file formats](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table).)
If you have files of a specialized or proprietary nature, be sure they are
accompanied by any pertinent information that would allow the proper
viewing and/or usage of the file. This information can be included in the
"Methods" or “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files.

#### What are the size limits?

There is a limit of 2GB per file and 10GB per dataset. All data files are
stored in the Merritt Repository. More information about the Merritt
Repository Service is available in the white paper
"[UC3, Merritt and Long-term Preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf)."
Contact [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for information on submitting
larger datasets.

### What features do you offer?

#### What feature do you offer to make my dataset have the broadest reach? 

Comprehensive documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key for dicoverability as well as ensuring future researchers understand the data. Without thorough metadata (description of the context of the data file, the context in which
the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality
of the data), the data cannot be found through internet searches or data
indexing services, understood by fellow researchers, or effectively used. Read more about
metadata in the
[DataONE Primer on Data Management](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

We require a few key pieces of metadata. Additional information can be
included in the “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files. The metadata entry
form for Dash is based on fields from the
[DataCite schema](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/index.html) and is broadly applicable to data from any field.

#### Does the data have to be associated with a publication?

No. We accept all quality data, regardless of whether they have been
used to publish a paper.

#### Can I obtain a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) before I upload my data in Dash?

Yes. To obtain a DOI, you must submit a minimal amount of required
description, but you can return later to upload the data files.

#### Do you support data embargoes or restricted access?

Not at this time. We do have plans to expand the Dash functionality to
include both. If you have specific requests for functionality, please add
them to our [GitHub Issues page](http://github.com/cdluc3/dash/issues).  

Note: You are free to stage your dataset publications. Your data will not be exposed to the public until you click "Submit". 

### Who will find my data?

#### How are the datasets dscoverable?

All datasets will be indexed by the
[Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/about/)
and [Scopus](http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus). Furthermore, each dataset
is given a unique Digital Object Identifier or DOI. Entering the
DOI URL in any browser will take the user to the dataset's landing page in
Merritt. Dash also provides a faceted search and browse capability for
direct discovery.

#### Who can access and use datasets?

Every dataset landing page includes usage information associated with the
dataset. Data found in Dash may be associated with any of the following licensing
terms:

1. Custom Data Use Agreement.
2. [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   (CC-BY-4.0). According to the terms of the CC-BY license, reuse of the
   data must include appropriate credit and must indicate if changes were
   made.
3. [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication Waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
   (CC0). This waiver has no restrictions on use and encourages reuse of
   data for any and all purposes.

All new data intended for DashONE Dash must be submitted under the terms of
the CC0 waiver; data intended for any of the UC campus instances must be
submitted under the terms of the CC-BY license.

Note: data contributed before Dash's standardization to these two licensing
regimes retain their original licensing terms.

Although many researchers would prefer to maintain more control over who
downloads and uses their data, we believe that fully open data best
supports the advancement of knowledge. Read the
[Panton Principles for Open Data in Science](http://pantonprinciples.org/)
for more information.

#### Do I need to log in to access published datasets?

No. Users can download data without logging in.

### How can I use published datasets?

#### Do I have to pay to download/reuse published datasets?

No. These data are made publicly available free of charge.

#### What are my obligations if I use the data in a publication?

Except for some legacy datasets that were released with custom use
agreements, data is released under the terms of the
[Creative Commons Attribution license ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)(CC-BY-4.0).
This means that you can use the data for any purpose, but you must give
proper attribution to the creators. To do so, we ask that you cite the data
formally in the reference section of your publication. Each dataset’s
landing page includes a suggested citation.

Note: datasets in DataONE Dash are in the public domain under a
[Creative Commons Universal waiver ](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)(CC0).
You have no legal obligations, but we do ask that you cite the data
formally when practical to acknowledge the creators and to make your own
research more reproducible.

### What guarantees do you give?

#### For how long will the data be available?

Data deposited in Dash are permanently archived and available through the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/)'s
[Merritt Repository](https://merritt.cdlib.org/). For a full description
of the services provided by Merritt, see this document:
[UC3, Merritt, and Long-term preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf).

Preservation policy details include:

- **Retention period**: Items will be retained indefinitely, at the
  discretion of the participating campus library and/or UC3.
- **Functional preservation:** Dash makes no promises of usability and
  understandability of deposited objects over time.
- **File preservation**: Data files are replicated with multiple copies in
  multiple geographic locations; metadata are backed up on a nightly
  basis.
- **Fixity and authenticity**: All data files are stored along with a
  SHA-256 checksum of the file content. Regular checks of files against
  their checksums are made. The audit process cycles continually, with a
  current cycle time of approximately two months.
- **Succession plans**: In case of closure of the repository, reasonable
  efforts will be made to integrate all content into suitable alternative
  institutional and/or subject based repositories.

#### Do you check to ensure the quality of the data?

No. Data found in this service is self-deposited by researchers and may or may not have
undergone formal review.

All information is provided "as-is" and the user shall hold the California
Digital Library, UC Campus, and any information provider supplying data free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.

### Can I update or remove published data?

#### Can I update my data?

Yes, you can update both the description and the data files. All versions
of a dataset will be accessible and kept in the Merritt Repository, but the
dataset DOI will always resolve to the newest version. Contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for more information.

#### Can I delete my data?

Data deposited is intended to remain permanently archived and
available. Deletion of a deposited dataset is considered an exceptional
action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the
original contributor (e.g., if sensitive human subject data was not
properly de-identified). If your data must be deleted, contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu).

#### Can a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) be revoked?

Content not considered to fall under the scope of the repository will be
removed and associated DOIs issued by Dash revoked. Please signal promptly
any suspected policy violations, ideally no later than 24 hours from
upload. User access may be revoked on violation of
[Terms of Use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html).
