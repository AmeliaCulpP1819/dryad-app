# About

## Overview

Dash is a self-service tool for researchers to preserve and publish their
research data.

Dash helps researchers:

- Select data files for preservation through local file browse or
    drag-and-drop operation.

- Promote citation and reuse of their data by describing it in terms of the
    domain-agnostic DataCite metadata schema.

- Identify data with a persistent DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for
    permanent citation and discovery.

- Preserve and publish data by uploading to a public collection in the
    [Merritt repository](https://merritt.cdlib.org/).

- Discover and retrieve data via search and browse.

UC Dash is targeted for use by the ten University of California campuses.
UC Dash accepts research data of any type from and field. There are
currently seven live instances of UC Dash:

- [UC Berkeley](https://dash.berkeley.edu/)

- [UC Irvine](https://dash.lib.uci.edu/)

- [UC Merced](https://dash.ucmerced.edu/)

- [UC Office of the President](https://dash.ucop.edu/)

- [UC Riverside](https://dash.ucr.edu/)

- [UC Santa Cruz](https://dash.ucsc.edu/)[](https://dash.ucsc.edu/)

- [UC San Francisco](https://datashare.ucsf.edu/)

[DataONE Dash](https://oneshare.cdlib.org/) / ONEShare is a separate
preservation and publication service for Earth observational data. DataONE
Dash is operated by CDL in collaboration with the
[DataONE project](http://dataone.org/), and is open to all researchers,
regardless of institutional affiliation.

    functionality.

## Why Publish Data?

- Promote transparency and reproducibility in research.

- Allow researchers to get direct credit for the data they generate— add it
    to CVs, share it with colleagues, and enable others to cite a dataset
    when using it.

- Meet funder and publisher requirements for data availability.

- Increase chances for collaboration and data re-use.

## Who We Are

UC Dash is a collaboration between the
[UC Libraries](http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/) and the
[UC Curation Center](http://cdlib.org/uc3) (UC3) at the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/).

## The California Digital Library (CDL) and the UC Curation Center (UC3)

The [CDL](http://www.cdlib.org/) was founded by the University of
California in 1997 to take advantage of emerging technologies that were
transforming the way digital information was being published and accessed.
Since then, in collaboration with the UC libraries and other partners, we
assembled one of the world’s largest digital research libraries and changed
the ways that faculty, students, and researchers discover and access
information.

[UC3](http://cdlib.org/uc3) is a creative partnership bringing together the
expertise and resources of the CDL, the ten UC campuses, and the broader
international curation community. The group fosters collaborative analysis,
projects and solutions to ensure the long-term viability and usability of
curated digital content. Examples of tools and services include the
[Merritt Repository Service](https://merritt.cdlib.org/) and
[Data Management Planning Tool](https://dmptool.org/) (DMPTool).

## Dash Origins

The Dash project began as [DataShare](http://datashare.ucsf.edu/), a
collaboration among [UC3](http://www.cdlib.org/uc3), the
[University of California San Francisco Library and Center for Knowledge Management](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/),
and the
[UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute](http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/)
(CTSI). CTSI is part of the Clinical and Translational Science Award
program funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
at the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number UL1 TR000004).
