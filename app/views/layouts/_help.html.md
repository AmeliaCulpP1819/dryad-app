## Submission Basics
We have some general reminders and suggestions for publishign your data in general and on Dash:
- We accept all file formats, although it is good practice to share data using open formats. See the [UK Data Archive](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table) for a list of optimal file formats
- Include any files that may help others to use your data. This includes readme files, formal metadata files, or other critical information
- Any data submitted will be under the [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). We do not currently support any other license types, nor do we allow for restrictions on data access or use
- It is your responsibility to ensure your data are being shared responsibly and ethically. Please be careful of sharing sensitive data and ensure you are complying with institutional and governmental regulations
- Inform your dataset co-creators that you plan to publish the dataset
- Ensure that all governmental and institutional regulations regarding the handling of sensitive data are addressed
- Prepare or obtain the most up-to-date and complete version of dataset. This includes relevant explanatory documents necessary for the re-use and replication of your dataset (e.g., readme.txt files, formal metadata records, or other critical information, etc.)
- Gather all metadata to be entered in the first page of the submission form. See Metadata Basics section below for more information.


## Metadata
Comprehensive data documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key to future understanding of data. Without a thorough description of the context of the data file, the context in which the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality of the data, it is unlikely that the data can be easily discovered, understood, or effectively used. Metadata is important not only to help people understand and make proper use of a data resource, but metadata also makes the resource discoverable (for example through internet searches or data indexing services). Read more about metadata in the [DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

A complete list of our default metadata fields is below. Additional metadata can be uploaded alongside the dataset (e.g., as a readme.txt file). Our default metadata entry form is based on fields from the metadata schema of the DOI issuing agency, DataCite.

Required Fields:

- Title : Title of the dataset. Make sure to be as descriptive as possible
- Author(s) or Data Creator(s) : Name, email address, institutional affliation of main researcher(s) involved in producing the data.  If you include your [ORCID](http://orcid.org), we will request the ORCID registry auto-populate this publication on your ORCID profile
- Abstract: Short description of dataset

Optional Fields (the more you describe your dataset, the wider the reach):

- Keyword(s) : Descriptive words that may help others discover your dataset. We recommend that you determine whether your discipline has an existing controlled vocabulary from which to choose your keywords. Please enter as many keywords as applicable
- Methods : Any technical or methodological information that may help others to understand how the data were generated (i.e. equipment/tools/reagents used, or procedures followed)
- Usage Notes : Any technical or methodological information that may help others determine how the data may be properly re-used, replicated, or re-analyzed
- Funding Information : Name of the funding organization that supported creation of the resource, including applicable grant number(s)
- Related Works : Use this field to indicate other resources that are associated with the data. Examples include publications, other datasets, code etc.
-  Location information : Include the geo-coordinates or name of the location where your data were generated or the location that is the focus of your research

## Upload Methods
We have two different options for uploading your data. 
- Upload directly from your computer: by using drag and drop or the upload button. We allow for 10gb of data per DOI to be uploaded this way. 
- Upload from a server or the cloud: by entering the URL of the location where data are held on a server, or the sharing link for Box, Dropbox, or Google Drive. We allow for 100gb of data per DOI to be validated and uploaded this way.

Please note that you may only use one of these two upload methods per version, but you may do subsequent versions of your data publication and utilize different methods of upload this way.

## Publication and Citation
- We do allow for you to delay the publication of your data if for the purposes of having a related article under peer review. If you do choose to utilize this feature we allow for up to a maximum of 180 days to delay publication. 
- As soon as your data publication is public we recommend citing and publicizing your work with your given DOI. 
- If you have edits, additional data, or subsequent related work we recommend versioning your data by using the "update" link. Your subsequent versions will appear on the same landing page that your DOI directs to.

##  Frequently Asked Questions
You are accessing a self-service data publication service developed by the California Digital Library.  This service is branded under different names: Dash, datashare, and ONEshare.  Don't worry, each of these brands offer the same product and features.  Below are FAQs.  Unless otherwise mentioned, all infomration below covers all instances of our service.


### Who can use?

#### Who can publish data?

This site is targeted for use by members of the University of California and DataONE communities. Researchers in any field from participating UC campuses (with exception, see Davis below) can use their campus credentials to deposit data in their campus-specific website. The following nine institutions currently participate:

- [UC Berkeley](https://dash.berkeley.edu/)
- [UC Irvine](https://dash.lib.uci.edu/)
- [UC Merced](https://dash.ucmerced.edu/)
- [UC Office of the President](https://dash.ucop.edu/)
- [UC Riverside](https://dash.ucr.edu/)
- [UC Santa Cruz](https://dash.library.ucsc.edu/)
- [UC San Francisco](https://datashare.ucsf.edu/)
- UC Davis College of Engineering (https://dash.ucdavis.edu)
- DataONE ONEShare (https://oneshare.cdlib.org/)

Contact [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for more information.

#### Can I use if my campus is not listed?

Anyone can search, view and download datasets. However, for each campus-specific website, data submission is limited to individuals
affiliated with that campus.  Contact [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for more information.

#### What is ONEshare?
ONEshare is a service, operated by CDL in collaboration with the
[DataONE project](http://dataone.org/). Anyone can deposit Environmental and Earth observation data within
[ONEshare](https://oneshare.cdlib.org/). Contact uc3@ucop.edu for more
information.

#### What type of data is within scope?

All fields of scholarship. All types of research data. However, this service is
intended for complete, re-usable, open research datasets and all content must not violate
privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or nondisclosure for data
collected from human subjects.

#### What are the size limits?

There is a limit of 100gb per data publication. All data files are
stored and preserved in the Merritt Repository. More information about the Merritt
Repository Service is available in the white paper
"[UC3, Merritt and Long-term Preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf)."

#### Does the data have to be associated with a publication?

No. We encourage and accept all quality data, regardless of whether they have been
used to publish a paper to be deposited, shared, and preserved.


#### How are the datasets discoverable?

All datasets will be indexed by the
[Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/about/)
and [Scopus](http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus). Furthermore, each dataset
is given a unique Digital Object Identifier or DOI. Entering the
DOI URL in any browser will take the user to the dataset's landing page in
Merritt. This service also provides a faceted search and browse capability for
direct discovery.

#### Who can access and use datasets?

Every dataset landing page includes usage information associated with the
dataset. Data may be associated with any of the following licensing
terms:

1. Custom Data Use Agreement.
2. [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   (CC-BY-4.0). According to the terms of the CC-BY license, reuse of the
   data must include appropriate credit and must indicate if changes were
   made.
3. [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication Waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
   (CC0). This waiver has no restrictions on use and encourages reuse of
   data for any and all purposes.

All new data intended for ONEshare must be submitted under the terms of
the CC0 waiver; data intended for any of the UC campus instances must be
submitted under the terms of the CC-BY license.

Note: data contributed before standardization to these two licensing
regimes retain their original licensing terms.

Although many researchers would prefer to maintain more control over who
downloads and uses their data, we believe that fully open data best
supports the advancement of knowledge. Read the
[Panton Principles for Open Data in Science](http://pantonprinciples.org/)
for more information.


#### What feature do you offer to make my dataset have the broadest reach?

Comprehensive documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key for dicoverability as well as ensuring future researchers understand the data. Without thorough metadata (description of the context of the data file, the context in which
the data were collected, the measurements that were made, and the quality
of the data), the data cannot be found through internet searches or data
indexing services, understood by fellow researchers, or effectively used. 

We require a few key pieces of metadata. Additional information can be
included in the “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files. The metadata entry
form is based on fields from the
[DataCite schema](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/index.html) and is broadly applicable to data from any field.


#### Do I have to pay to download/reuse published datasets?

No. These data are made publicly available free of charge under the CCBY 4.0 license.

#### What are my obligations if I use the data in a publication?

Except for some legacy datasets that were released with custom use
agreements, data is released under the terms of the
[Creative Commons Attribution license ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)(CC-BY-4.0).
This means that you can use the data for any purpose, but you must give
proper attribution to the creators. To do so, we ask that you cite the data
formally in the reference section of your publication. Each dataset’s
landing page includes a suggested citation.

Note: datasets in ONEshare are in the public domain under a
[Creative Commons Universal waiver ](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)(CC0).
You have no legal obligations, but we do ask that you cite the data
formally when practical to acknowledge the creators and to make your own
research more reproducible.


#### For how long will the data be available?

Data deposited are permanently archived and available through the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/)'s
[Merritt Repository](https://merritt.cdlib.org/). For a full description
of the services provided by Merritt, see this document:
[UC3, Merritt, and Long-term preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf).

Preservation policy details include:

- **Retention period**: Items will be retained indefinitely, at the
  discretion of the participating campus library and/or UC3.
- **Functional preservation:** We make no promises of usability and
  understandability of deposited objects over time.
- **File preservation**: Data files are replicated with multiple copies in
  multiple geographic locations; metadata are backed up on a nightly
  basis.
- **Fixity and authenticity**: All data files are stored along with a
  SHA-256 checksum of the file content. Regular checks of files against
  their checksums are made. The audit process cycles continually, with a
  current cycle time of approximately two months.
- **Succession plans**: In case of closure of the repository, reasonable
  efforts will be made to integrate all content into suitable alternative
  institutional and/or subject based repositories.

#### Do you check to ensure the quality of the data?

No. Data found in this service is self-deposited by researchers and may or may not have
undergone formal review.

All information is provided "as-is" and the user shall hold the California
Digital Library, UC Campus, and any information provider supplying data free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.

#### Can I update my data?

Yes, you can update both the description and the data files. All versions
of a dataset will be accessible and kept in the Merritt Repository, but the
dataset DOI will always resolve to the newest version. 

#### Can I delete my data?

Data deposited is intended to remain permanently archived and
available. Deletion of a deposited dataset is considered an exceptional
action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the
original contributor (e.g., if sensitive human subject data was not
properly de-identified). If your data must be deleted, contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu).

#### Can a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) be revoked?

Content not considered to fall under the scope of the repository will be
removed and associated DOIs issued revoked. Please signal promptly
any suspected policy violations, ideally no later than 24 hours from
upload. User access may be revoked on violation of
[Terms of Use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html).
