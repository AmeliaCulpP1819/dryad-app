# About

## Overview

Dash is a simple self-service tool for researchers to use in publishing
their datasets. It provides tools for the effective publication of and
access to research data.

## Dash helps you:

- Follow best practices when creating or acquiring data.
- Select data for curation through local file browse or drag-and-drop
  operation.
- Describe data in terms of the DataCite metadata schema.
- Identify data with a persistent DOI for permanent citation and discovery.
- Preserve, Manage, and Share data by uploading to a public Merritt
  collection.
- Discover and retrieve data through faceted search and browse.

## Importance of Data Sharing

Data sharing is critical for the advancement of scientific knowledge.
Researchers benefit from increased collaborations, validation, and
recognition of their work; institutions and funders benefit from the
measurable increase in the impact of their resources; and society benefits
from the faster pace at which science can progress. There are several
barriers to providing access to data, and currently data sharing is mostly
done by large, well funded multi-investigator projects. If these barriers
were addressed, allowing individual investigators to easily and quickly
share their primary research data, we could create a new culture of
transparency and efficiency—likely resulting in major impacts on scientific
advancement.

## Who We Are

UC Berkeley Dash is a collaborative project between the
[UC Berkeley Library](http://lib.berkeley.edu/) and the
[UC Curation Center](http://cdlib.org/uc3) (UC3) at the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/).

### UC Berkeley Library

The University Library is comprised of 20 campus Libraries—including the
Doe/Moffitt Libraries, the Bancroft Library, the C. V. Starr East Asian
Library and subject specialty libraries. The library supports a range of
data support services including EZID, the DMPTool and DASH. For more
information on these services visit the
library[*data services page*](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/how-to-find/data-gis).

### UC Curation Center (UC3)

The UC3 is a creative partnership bringing together the expertise and
resources of the CDL, the ten UC campuses, and the broader international
curation community. The group fosters collaborative analysis, projects and
solutions to ensure the long-term viability and usability of curated
digital content. Examples of tools and services include the
[Merritt Repository Service](https://merritt.cdlib.org/), and
[Data Management Planning Tool](https://dmptool.org/) (DMPTool).

## Dash Origins

The Dash project began as [DataShare](http://datashare.ucsf.edu/), a
collaboration among [UC3](http://www.cdlib.org/uc3), the
[University of California San Francisco Library and Center for Knowledge Management](http://www.library.ucsf.edu/),
and the
[UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute](http://ctsi.ucsf.edu/)
(CTSI). CTSI is part of the Clinical and Translational Science Award
program funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
at the National Institutes of Health (Grant Number UL1 TR000004).
