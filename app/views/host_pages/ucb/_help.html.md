## Users

### Who can deposit data with University of California instances of Dash?

Any UC Berkeley-affiliated researcher (faculty, postdoc, student, or staff)
can use this resource to archive and share research datasets, provided they
have appropriate permission. Data that are collected at research sites are
under the stewardship of the Principal Investigator (PI) named on the
resource provided to collect the data, and this PI may grant permission to
deposit data.

### What if I have collaborators outside of UC Berkeley?

You will need UC Berkeley credentials to log into the system and deposit
data. You can, however, add your collaborators to the "data contributors"
section of the metadata. Although only researchers logged in with UC
Berkeley credentials can deposit data, anyone can search, view and download
datasets in Dash.

### Who can deposit data with DataONE Dash?

Anyone can deposit Environmental and Earth observation data with
[DataONE Dash](https://oneshare.cdlib.org/). DataONE Dash is a separate
service, operated by CDL in collaboration with the
[DataONE project](http://dataone.org/). Contact uc3@ucop.edu for more
information.

## Depositing and Publishing Data

### What is the content scope of UC Dash?

All fields of scholarship. All types of research artifacts. Dash is
intended for complete, final research datasets. Content must not violate
privacy or copyright, or breach confidentiality or nondisclosure for data
collected from human subjects.

### How should I prepare to submit data?

- Obtain permission from the appropriate Principal Investigators(s) and
  inform any dataset co-creators that you plan to deposit the dataset in
  Dash.
- Take care when sharing sensitive data, and be certain to comply with
  institutional and governmental regulations. It is your responsibility
  to share your data responsibly and ethically.
- Collect the files comprising the data set. Name files systematically and
  use open file formats whenever possible (see the UK Data Archive for a
  [list of optimal file formats](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table)).
  Gather the following information to fully describe the dataset:
- Dataset title - be as specific as possible
- Full names and institutional affiliations of all dataset co-creators
- Keywords for the dataset (use discipline-specific controlled vocabularies
  whenever possible)
- Abstract briefly describing the dataset you are submitting– What is the
  data? Why was it collected?
- Description of the methods used to collect the data
- Citations to associated materials, including grant numbers, publications
  using the dataset, and other related datasets
- If relevant, information about where the data was collected (e.g., the
  placename or lat/long coordinates)
- Any other information that you would want to relay to someone analyzing
  your data

For generic data management help, see the
[DataONE Primer on Data Management Best Practices](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

### What are the file format requirements?

Dash accepts files in any format for deposit. However, we recommend using
non-proprietary/open file types to make the data readable by more
researchers over a longer span of time. (See the UK Data Archive for a
[list of optimal file formats](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/format/formats-table).)
If you have files of a specialized or proprietary nature, be sure they are
accompanied by any pertinent information that would allow the proper
viewing and/or usage of the file. This information can be included in the
"Methods" or “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files.

### What are the size limits?

There is a limit of 2GB per file and 10GB per dataset. All data files are
stored in the Merritt Repository. More information about the Merritt
Repository Service is available in the white paper
"[UC3, Merritt and Long-term Preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf)."
Contact [uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for information on submitting
larger datasets.

### Why is complete documentation so important?

Comprehensive documentation (i.e. metadata) is the key to future
understanding of the data. Without a thorough description of the context of
the data file, the context in which the data were collected, the
measurements that were made, and the quality of the data, the data can not
be found (through internet searches or data indexing services), understood,
or effectively used. Read more about metadata in the
[DataONE Primer on Data Management](http://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf)
(PDF).

Dash requires a few key pieces of metadata. Additional information can be
included in the “Usage Notes” section of the description, or as a separate
readme.txt file archived alongside the dataset files. The metadata entry
form for Dash is based on fields from the
[DataCite schema](http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-3/index.html),
version 3.0, and is broadly applicable to data from any field.

### Does the data have to be associated with a publication?

No. Dash accepts all quality data, regardless of whether they have been
used to publish a paper.

### Can I obtain a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) before I upload my data in Dash?

Yes. To obtain a DOI, you must submit a minimal amount of required
description, but you can return later to upload the data files.

### Do you support data embargoes or restricted access?

Not at this time. We do have plans to expand the Dash functionality to
include both. If you have specific requests for functionality, please add
them to our [GitHub Issues page](http://github.com/cdluc3/dash/issues).

## Accessing and Using Data

### How will anyone find my data?

Dash datasets will be indexed by the
[Thomson-Reuters Data Citation Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/about/)
and [Scopus](http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus). All datasets in
Dash are given a unique Digital Object Identifier or DOI. Entering the DOI
URL in any browser will take the user to the dataset's landing page in
Merritt. Dash also provides a faceted search and browse capability for
direct discovery.

### Who can access and use datasets in Dash?

Every dataset landing page includes usage information associated with the
dataset.

Data found in Dash may be associated with any of the following licensing
terms:

1. Custom Data Use Agreement.
2. [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   (CC-BY-4.0). According to the terms of the CC-BY license, reuse of the
   data must include appropriate credit and must indicate if changes were
   made.
3. [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication Waiver](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
   (CC0). This waiver has no restrictions on use and encourages reuse of
   data for any and all purposes.

All new data intended for DashONE Dash must be submitted under the terms of
the CC0 waiver; data intended for any of the UC campus instances must be
submitted under the terms of the CC-BY license.

Note: data contributed before Dash's standardization to these two licensing
regimes retain their original licensing terms.

Although many researchers would prefer to maintain more control over who
downloads and uses their data, we believe that fully open data best
supports the advancement of knowledge. Read the
[Panton Principles for Open Data in Science](http://pantonprinciples.org/)
for more information.

### Do I need to log into Dash to get data?

No. Users can download data without logging in.

### Do I have to pay to download the data?

No. These data are made publicly available free of charge.

### What are my obligations if I use the data in a publication?

Except for some legacy datasets that were released with custom use
agreements, data in UC Dash is released under the terms of the
[Creative Commons Attribution license ](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)(CC-BY-4.0).
This means that you can use the data for any purpose, but you must give
proper attribution to the creators. To do so, we ask that you cite the data
formally in the reference section of your publication. Each dataset’s
landing page includes a suggested citation.

Data in DataONE Dash is in the public domain under a
[Creative Commons Universal waiver ](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)(CC0).
You have no legal obligations, but we do ask that you cite the data
formally when practical to acknowledge the creators and to make your own
research more reproducible.

### For how long will the data be available?

Data deposited in Dash is permanently archived and available through the
[California Digital Library](http://cdlib.org/)'s
[Merritt Repository](https://merritt.cdlib.org/). For a full description of
the services provided by Merritt, see this document:
[UC3, Merritt, and Long-term preservation](https://merritt.cdlib.org/d/ark%3A%2F13030%2Fm52f7p63/2/producer%2FUC3-Merritt-preservation-latest.pdf).

Preservation policy details include:

- **Retention period**: Items will be retained indefinitely, at the
  discretion of the participating campus library and/or UC3.
- **Functional preservation:** Dash makes no promises of usability and
  understandability of deposited objects over time.
- **File preservation**: Data files are replicated with multiple copies in
  multiple geographic locations; metadata are backed up on a nightly
  basis.
- **Fixity and authenticity**: All data files are stored along with a
  SHA-256 checksum of the file content. Regular checks of files against
  their checksums are made. The audit process cycles continually, with a
  current cycle time of approximately two months.
- **Succession plans**: In case of closure of the repository, reasonable
  efforts will be made to integrate all content into suitable alternative
  institutional and/or subject based repositories.

### Do UC or CDL guarantee the quality of Dash data?

No. Dash data is self-deposited by researchers and may or may not have
undergone formal review.

All information is provided "as-is" and the user shall hold the California
Digital Library, UC Campus, and information providers supplying data to
Dash free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.

## Updating or Removing Data

### Can I update my data?

Yes, you can update both the description and the data files. All versions
of a dataset will be accessible and kept in the Merritt Repository, but the
dataset DOI will always resolve to the newest version. Contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu) for more information.

### Can I delete my data?

Data deposited in Dash is intended to remain permanently archived and
available. Deletion of a deposited dataset is considered an exceptional
action which normally should be requested and fully justified by the
original contributor (e.g., if sensitive human subject data was not
properly de-identified). If your data must be deleted, contact
[uc3@ucop.edu](mailto:uc3@ucop.edu).

### Can a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) be revoked?

Content not considered to fall under the scope of the repository will be
removed and associated DOIs issued by Dash revoked. Please signal promptly
any suspected policy violations, ideally no later than 24 hours from
upload. User access may be revoked on violation of
[Terms of Use](http://www.cdlib.org/about/terms.html).
