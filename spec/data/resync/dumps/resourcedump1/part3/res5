Whatever it was that led to the extinction of the Mesozoic reptiles,
it was probably some very far-reaching change indeed, for the life of
the seas did at the same time undergo a similar catastrophic
alteration. The crescendo and ending of the Reptiles on land was
paralleled by the crescendo and ending of the Ammonites, a division of
creatures like squids with coiled shells which swarmed in those
ancient seas. All though the rocky record of this Mesozoic period
there is a vast multitude and variety of these coiled shells; there
are hundreds of species, and towards the end of the Mesozoic period
they increased in diversity and produced exaggerated types. When the
record resumes these, too, have gone.
