Strong as his convictions on the subject then were, it is a fact, that
he stood very much alone, for the alternating current had no well
recognized place. Few electrical engineers had ever used it, and the
majority were entirely unfamiliar with its value, or even its
essential features. Even Mr. Tesla himself did not, until after
protracted effort and experimentation, learn how to construct
alternating current apparatus of fair efficiency.
