The Wool of Apulia is held in the highest Estimation; then, that which
in Italy is named the Greek Sheep's Wool, but in other Countries is
called Italian. In the third Rank stands the Milesian Sheep. The Wool
of Apulia is of a short Staple, and is of Reputation for nothing
beside Mantles.  About Tarentum and Canusium the richest of this Kind
are found: as also at Laodicea in Asia. For Whiteness there is none
better than that which groweth along the Po; and yet to this Day a
Pound of it hath not exceeded the Price of an hundred Sesterces. They
do not shear Sheep everywhere; for the Custom of plucking their Fleece
continueth still in some Places.
