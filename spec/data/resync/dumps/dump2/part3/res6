Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that
other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also
pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the
horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone:
for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend
itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the
stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as
much as it advances that of the other.
