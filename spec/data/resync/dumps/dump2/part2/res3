The object of honing the razor, as has been explained, is to abraid
and wear away the edge of the blade so that it becomes as thin as
possible. But when this is done, the process of sharpening the razor
is still incomplete, for the edge, when taken from the hone, is left
rough and unfit to put on the face. Another process is necessary,
and that is stropping. The object of stropping is not to make the
blade thinner, but to smooth the edge, taking off the rough surface
of the little teeth which have been developed, and setting them all in
perfect alignment. This gives the razor its exceeding keenness.
