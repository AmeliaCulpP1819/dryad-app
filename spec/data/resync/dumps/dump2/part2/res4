That linguistics should continue to be the prerogative of a few
specialists would be unthinkable -- everyone is concerned with it in
one way or another. But -- and this is a paradoxical consequence of the
interest that is fixed on hnguistics -- there is no other field in
which so many absurd notions, prejudices, mirages, and fictions have
sprung up. From the psychological viewpoint these errors are of
interest, but the task of the linguist is, above all else, to condemn
them and to dispel them as best he can.
