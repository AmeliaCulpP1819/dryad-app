# Questions

## How do we set the `User-Agent` and `From` headers when making our HTTP requests?

## How should we configure the harvesting URL we pass to `OAI::Client::new`?

## Are there other configuration parameters?

# Notes

## `ruby-oai` provides an `OAI::Provider` that could front a dummy repository for testing purposes
