   <dc:description>Project: CLM regional climate model runs forced by the global IPCC scenario runs
These regional climate simulations have been funded by the BMBF and computed at DKRZ by the group "Model and Data" of MPI-M, Hamburg, in close cooperation with BTU Cottbus, GKSS Geesthacht and PIK Potsdam. Serving as community model, the climate version of the local model (CLM) of the DWD was used to simulate the regional climate of the 20th century (1960-2000) and 21st century (2001-2100) in Europe. The regional model runs are forced by the global IPCC scenario runs (http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/index.htm ) to explore future developments in the European climate on a regional scale.
CLM (see http://clm.gkss.de ) was run in non hydrostatic mode with 0.165 degree horizontal grid resolution and was forced 6 hourly by the output of the global climate model runs with ECHAM5/MPIOM. The climate of the 20th century was simulated by three 20th century realization runs, set off at different initialization times. The climate of the 21st century was modeled with respect to two IPCC-climate scenarios (A1B and B1) with different assumptions regarding the development of global greenhouse gas concentrations.
For storage in and download from this data base, the data has been transformed into time series of single model variables and is provided in two different data streams (referenced as "data stream 2" and "data stream 3"). Data stream 2 is given on a rotated grid with 0.165 deg. spatial resolution (rotated coordinates). Data stream 3 is projected onto a non-rotated grid with 0.2 deg. spatial resolution (usual geographical coordinates). For the data transformation between the respective grids the cdo-routines have been used.
For the original model output (referenced as "data stream 0" and "data stream 1") please contact model(at)dkrz.de for further information.
See http://sga.wdc-climate.de for more details on CLM simulations in the context of the BMBF funding priority "klimazwei", some useful information on handling climate model data and the data access regulations.
Summary: The experiment CLM_C20_3_D3 contains European regional climate simulations of the years 1960-2000 on a regular geographical grid. The data are generated during post processing of the corresponding data stream 2 experiment (CLM_C20_3_D2) of regional climate model runs (CLM non hydrostatic, see http://clm.gkss.de ). The simulations of the 20th century (1960-2000) have been forced by the third (_3_) run of the global 20th century climate (EH5-T63L31_OM-GR1.5L40_20C_3_6H) with observed anthropogenic forcing.
In data stream 3 (_D3) the output variables of CLM data stream 2 and some additionally derived parameters are stored as time series on a regular grid with a horizontal spacing of 0.2 degree. The model parameters have been transformed onto the regular geographical grid by the CDO routines. Please note, that none of the variables has been corrected for topographical differences between the two grids. The model domain of data stream 3 covers the European region starting at 34.6/-10.6 (lat/lon, centre of lower left grid box) with an increment of 0.2 degree. The number of grid points is 177/238 (lat/lon).
For some model variables and additionally derived parameters some statistics on daily, monthly or yearly basis are available. See also http://sga.wdc-climate.de for a list of available parameters.
