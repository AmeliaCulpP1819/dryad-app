On account of the fact that the Cherokees thought that the
missionaries were bringing back to them their old religion, it was a
comparatively easy task to convert them from a tribe of savages to a
Christian nation within the comparatively short period of thirty
years. When they were converted, they, at the behest of the
missionaries cast aside every vestige of their ancient customs to such
an extent that not any of their mythology has ever been preserved,
even among those of the tribe that speak the Cherokee language
preferably.
