Here is a good list of colors for practical work. The first eight are
enough for every purpose; but add, if you wish, purple and
orange. Moist colors in pans are best.  There are many different kinds
of red, green, blue and brown paints; and as you may be puzzled and
not know what to get, the names of the best hues of these particular
colors are also given. The most useful paints in this list are yellow
ochre, light red, Vandyke brown and Payne's gray.
