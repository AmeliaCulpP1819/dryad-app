But even the Continental (Dutch and Lower Rhenish) Pietism in the
Reformed Church was, at least funda- mentally, just as much a simple
intensification of the Reformed asceticism as, for instance, the
doctrines of Bailey. The emphasis was placed so strongly on the praxis
pietatis that doctrinal orthodoxy was pushed into the background; at
times, in fact, it seemed quite a matter of indifference. Those
predestined for grace could occasionally be subject to dogmatic error
as well as to other sins and experience showed that often those
Christians who were quite uninstructed in the theology of the schools
exhibited the fruits of faith most clearly, while on the other hand it
became evident that mere knowledge of theology by no means guaranteed
the proof of faith through conduct.
