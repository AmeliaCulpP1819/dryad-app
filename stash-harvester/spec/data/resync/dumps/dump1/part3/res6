From these considerations the reader might be tempted to infer that an
adequate view of the nature of the line could be obtained by imagining
it to be formed simply by the rational points which lie on it. And it
is certainly the case that if we imagine the line to be made up solely
of the rational points, and all other points (if there are any such)
to be eliminated, the figure which remained would possess most of the
properties which common sense attributes to the straight line, and
would, to put the matter roughly, look and behave very much like a
line.
